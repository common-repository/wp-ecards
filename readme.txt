This plugin allows you to easily create a post or page that acts as a virtual postcard application for your site visitors. 
Add it to one post or create your own ecard site using the built in WordPress category and page functionality.

This plugin is very much in development and depends on your feedback. Expect errors and report them. I will diligently update as needed.
